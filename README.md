Key features include:

- Converts speech to text automatically.
- Works offline, no internet needed.
- Supports English and Chinese languages, even mixed together.

## ⚙️ Features in Detail

### Offline transcription

AutoTranscribe does not send your data online. All work happens locally on your Mac. This keeps your files private and avoids internet slowdowns or extra costs.

### Speaker diarization

The app can tell when different people speak in your videos. It marks who says what, which helps with meetings or interviews.

### Language detection

AutoTranscribe supports Chinese, English, and mixed speech. The software automatically detects which language is spoken and transcribes accordingly.

### LaunchAgent integration

AutoTranscribe can run in the background using macOS launch agents. This means it can start automatically and keep watching for new files to transcribe without user intervention.

### Multiple video formats

The app accepts popular video formats like:

- MP4
- MOV
- AVI
- M4V

You can convert other formats to these if needed.
